                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Jonathan Baik, a software engineer from Fairfax, VA.
                </p>

                {/* <p>
                    I have experience in various areas of the tech stack, from designing back-end distributed systems
                    to implementing front-end UX features. 
                </p> */}

                <p>
                    After graduating from <a href="https://vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a> in the spring 
                    of 2019, I started at Capital One as an entry-level software engineer. While I had internship 
                    experience in various areas of the tech stack -- from designing back-end distributed systems to 
                    implementing front-end UX features -â€“ I was hard-pressed to say I had found my true passion in 
                    the software engineering field at that point.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    After leaving Capital One, I set out to find what I could give to the world with
                    my 
                </p>
